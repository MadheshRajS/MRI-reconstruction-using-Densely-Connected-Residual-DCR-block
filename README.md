★ Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) with Densely Connected Residual(DCR) block is built.

★ U-Net with Densely Connected Residual(DCR) block is built.

★ High quality reconstructed images with less noise and superior visual quality is produced.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) is used to extract images of soft tissues of human body. It is used to analyze the human organs without the need for surgery. 

Generally MRI images contain a significant amount of noise caused by operator performance, equipment and the environment, while processing if any noise is added to the image this can lead to difficulties in diagnostic characterization or object size.
## Scope
The proposed project can reconstruct images from the existing image that is 
extracted from the MRI machine. The reconstruct image have higher quality and less 
noise.
## Data Set
* https://www.nitrc.org/frs/?group_id=899

* 36 - 3Tesla Brain MRI dataset

* Dataset Size: 2.49 GB

## Qualitative Metrics
The qualitative metrics(PSNR-Peak Signal To Noise Ratio) obtained with each model is 
presented in this section:

## Future Enhancement
In future this work can be further improved with the help of different algorithms 
for improving the PSNR(Peak Signal To Noise Ratio)value. This work can be further 
developed by large datasets(2TB) and by using more techniques for improving the 
PSNR(Peak Signal To Noise Ratio)value and quality of the reconstructed image
