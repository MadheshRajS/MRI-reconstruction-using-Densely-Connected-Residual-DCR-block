## MRI Reconstruction using  Densely Connected Residual block

★ Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) with Densely Connected Residual(DCR) block is built.

★ U-Net with Densely Connected Residual(DCR) block is built.

★ High quality reconstructed images with less noise and superior visual quality is produced.
